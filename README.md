# Faria Anowara Adhora's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, I showcase a collection of projects I've worked on, which span a variety of fields including **Arduino programming**, **robotics**, **simulation**, and **engineering projects**. These projects were completed using various tools like **Arduino IDE**, **MIT App Inventor**, **MATLAB**, and more.

## Projects:

### 1. **[Mobile Controlled Car](https://github.com/adhora7/Mobile-Controlled-Car)**
   - **Description**: A mobile-controlled car using an **Arduino** and a **Bluetooth module (HC-05)**. The car is controlled via a mobile app that I developed using **MIT App Inventor**. The communication is handled wirelessly via Bluetooth, and the car can move forward, backward, and turn based on the app's commands.
   - **Tools Used**: Arduino, MIT App Inventor, Bluetooth (HC-05), L293D Motor Shield.
   - **Project Repository**: [Mobile Controlled Car Repository](https://github.com/adhora7/Mobile-Controlled-Car)



### 2. **[Simulation of Level 1 Rocket](https://github.com/adhora7/Simulation-of-level-1-rocket)**
   - **Description**: This project involved simulating a **Level 1 Rocket** using **OpenRocket** software. The simulation helped test and validate the rocket's trajectory and flight dynamics before any real-world implementation.
   - **Tools Used**: OpenRocket, MATLAB.
   - **Project Repository**: [Simulation of Level 1 Rocket Repository](https://github.com/adhora7/Simulation-of-level-1-rocket)
   - **Simulation Details**: [LinkedIn Post on Rocket Simulation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/faria-anowara-adhora_successfully-simulated-a-level1-rocket-activity-7280606526631825410-KCWz)

### 3. **[Obstacle Avoiding Car](https://github.com/adhora7/Obstacle-Avoiding-Car)**
   - **Description**: This project demonstrates an **obstacle-avoiding robot** using an **ultrasonic sensor** and **servo motor**. The robot detects obstacles and changes its path to avoid collisions.
   - **Tools Used**: Arduino, Ultrasonic Sensor, Servo Motor, L293D Motor Shield.
   - **Project Repository**: [Obstacle Avoiding Car Repository](https://github.com/adhora7/Obstacle-Avoiding-Car)

### 4. **[Radar Using Arduino](https://github.com/adhora7/Radar_Using_Arduino)**
   - **Description**: A radar system built using **Arduino** and an **ultrasonic sensor**. The servo motor sweeps the sensor across an area, and the distance data is visualized as a radar sweep.
   - **Tools Used**: Arduino, Ultrasonic Sensor, Servo Motor.
   - **Project Repository**: [Radar Using Arduino Repository](https://github.com/adhora7/Radar_Using_Arduino)

### 5. **[Wireless Power Transmission](https://github.com/adhora7/Wireless_Power_Transmission)**
   - **Description**: This project demonstrates **wireless power transmission** using an **Arduino** and an **inductive coupling** system to transfer power wirelessly to a receiver coil.
   - **Tools Used**: Arduino, Wireless Power Module.
   - **Project Repository**: [Wireless Power Transmission Repository](https://github.com/adhora7/Wireless_Power_Transmission)

### 6. **[Rocket Thrust Measurement](https://github.com/adhora7/Rocket_Thrust_Measurement)**
   - **Description**: This project focused on measuring the **thrust** of a rocket engine. The data obtained from this project can be used to validate engine performance.
   - **Tools Used**: MATLAB, Arduino, Sensors.
   - **Project Repository**: [Rocket Thrust Measurement Repository](https://github.com/adhora7/Rocket_Thrust_Measurement)

### 7. **[Certification](https://github.com/adhora7/Certification)**
   - **Description**: A repository showcasing the **MATLAB Onramp Certification** I earned, which helped enhance my skills in **data analysis**, **simulation**, and **modeling** with MATLAB. This repository includes the certificate and related resources.
   - **Tools Used**: MATLAB.
   - **Project Repository**: [MATLAB Certification Repository](https://github.com/adhora7/Certification)
